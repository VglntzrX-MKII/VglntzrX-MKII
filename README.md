- 👋 Hi, I’m @VglntzrX-MKII

- 👀 I’m interested in the ever-evolving world of technology, especially Windows and Linux systems! I love diving deep into their functionalities and exploring their potential.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the exciting world of Cybersecurity (always keeping up with the latest threats! ) and sharpening my skills in Docker containers (making those systems dance to my tune! )


- ⚡ Fun fact:  I'm proficient in Python, Bash, C, and Java - basically a programming polyglot ️ (I speak code fluently!).
